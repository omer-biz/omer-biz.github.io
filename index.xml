      <description>Screenshot with Vim In this post I will show you the easiest way I could come up for taking a screenshots and inserting them to a markdown file while taking notes using Neovim.
The title maybe confusing as I couldn&amp;rsquo;t come up with a shorter title myself. If you could come up with a shorter title please contact me.
I came up with this solution (and problem) while I was taking notes through my playing of CTFs and doing pentests.</description>
