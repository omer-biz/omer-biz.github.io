    <description><![CDATA[Narnia 7 - OverTheWire Intro This level is kind of a combination of the previous two Levels. You have to overwrite a function pointer, but you have to do it using a format string vulnerability there is no overflowing this time.
Now Let&rsquo;s run the program see what it does.
narnia7@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia7 Usage: ./narnia7 &lt;buffer&gt; narnia7@narnia:/narnia$ The program asks us for an input.
narnia7@narnia:/narnia$ ./narnia7 AAAA goodfunction() = 0x80486ff hackedfunction() = 0x8048724 before : ptrf() = 0x80486ff (0xffffd628) I guess you want to come to the hackedfunction.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Narnia 6 - OverTheWire Introduction This level is all about overflowing into a local variable, specifically to a local function pointer variable. When you run the program without any argument it will exit asking for 2 arguments. These two arguments are mapped or copied to the two local variables on the stack, namely b1, and b2. They are copied using strcpy which we know is not a safe way of copying from user inputs.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What is OverTheWire Overthewire is a really good resource for someone really new to cybersecurity to learn about cybersecurity. It has a hands on approach of teaching things. It has what I call Seasons. These so called Seasons are not actually numbered but rather named, and each season has an episode. At least that&rsquo;s how I imagine it in my head.
Each season teaches a different cybersecurity concept. For example season 1 (Bandit) teaches about the Linux Operating System.]]></description>
