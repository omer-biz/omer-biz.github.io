    <description><![CDATA[Narnia 6 - OverTheWire Introduction This level is all about overflowing into a local variable, specifically to a local function pointer variable. When you run the program without any argument it will exit asking for 2 arguments. These two arguments are mapped or copied to the two local variables on the stack, namely b1, and b2. They are copied using strcpy which we know is not a safe way of copying from user inputs.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[What is OverTheWire Overthewire is a really good resource for someone really new to cybersecurity to learn about cybersecurity.
