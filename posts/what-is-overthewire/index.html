<p><a href="https://www.overthewire.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">Overthewire</a> is a really good resource for someone really new to <strong>cybersecurity</strong> to learn
about <strong>cybersecurity</strong>. It has a hands on approach of teaching things. It has what I call
Seasons. These so called Seasons are not actually numbered but rather named,
and each season has an episode. At least that&rsquo;s how I imagine it in my head.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Each season teaches a different cybersecurity concept. For example season 1 (Bandit)
teaches about the Linux Operating System. And the way they do it is awesome. You don&rsquo;t
even have to install any kind of Linux on your system or use virtual machine. They already
have setup a remote server for you, you just have to login using <code>ssh</code> and you&rsquo;re good to
go.</p>
<p>As my eagerness to learn the hacking was starting to grow I had no idea where to go or where to
start. Hacking was, and still is considered a very bad thing in my society so this might also
have its own effects. I was always watching this youtube videos and reading on how to hack
Facebook or Gmail and these were big deal at that time. But after a while they become redundant.
And I had no new knowledge to acquire from them and it started to be boring.</p>
<p>After doing these for a while, as I said it was boring, I hear the term script kiddie
being used a lot. By further investigating this term I realized I&rsquo;m a script kiddie So my next
journey became to be a real hacker not a script kiddie. I even had Kali linux installed on
flash drive as persistence and would flex on some of my friends I also installed Kali linux
on my main and only laptop it was not long after that I realized it was a bad idea so
I removed kali and installed Ubuntu and Distro hopped a lot, that&rsquo;s a story for another time.</p>
<p>After I Googled around How not to be script kiddie
every blogpost I read was telling me to learn a programming language and every one
was recommending python, so I started to learn python. The main resource I used at that
time were the website <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">codecademy.com</a>, and &ldquo;Learn python the hard way by Zed A. Shaw&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t stop there it was around this time that I had to go to collage. I decided I was going
to learn Software Engineering because I loved computers duh. In my first and second year of
collage I had acquired knowledge in many languages like php, javascirpt, java, C, C++ and
so on. But I was no where near becoming a hacker, spoiler alert I&rsquo;m still no where near became
one.</p>
<p>While all this was happening I had a book I set aside and procrastinated a lot to read.
One day I was sitting in my dorm and I was really bored and looking around my filesystem, and
I stumbled upon this book I was setting aside for long time. The book goes by the title
&ldquo;Hacking: The Art of Exploitation, 2nd Edition, by Jon Erickson&rdquo;. I can not tell you how much I
loved it. This book opened a whole new world of hacking to me I was fascinated. By reading
this book and seeking more knowledge about the terms and techniques and wanting to know more
I had to dig up on the Internet for more knowledge and oh boy oh boy I was bookmarking a site
after site a book after book. That how I stumbled upon overthewire too.</p>
<p>I think this post is being too long so I will stop here and share with you all the resources like
youtube channels, websites and Blogs that you can go to learn hacking. This list will grow as I
obtain more resources.</p>
